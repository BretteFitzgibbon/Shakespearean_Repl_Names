# Shakespearean_Repl_Names

What This Program Does:
Those who use Replit know that their default Repl names are pretty quirky. Though they're unique, they all follow the format AdjectiveAdjectiveNoun. This program uses that formula with Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream" to create fey, whimsical Repl monikers.

What This Program Entails:

-- Uses a text file based on dream.xml, the "A Midsummer Night's Dream" file from the Shakespeare XML Corpus Sample on nltk.org. 

-- Uses NLTK part-of-speech tagging to read the text file and create lists of adjectives and nouns.

-- Shuffle sorts the adjectives and nouns to generate countless adjective-adjective-noun combinations. 


Sample Output:

-- Repl names: HighlevelLightgreyRatio, RelevantAmusingOpposites, FineWeakDigits

-- Shakespearean Repl names: AthenianBlamefulChaste, FairSweetGrace, MoreDevilish-holyConqueror


Future Directions:

-- Similar part-of-speech experiments can use other NLTK corpora, like Sample European Parliament Proceedings Paralle Corpus, Machado de Assis -- Obra Completa, Twitter Samples, C-SPAN Inaugural Address, and York-Toronto-Helsinki Parsed Corpus of Old English Prose. https://www.nltk.org/nltk_data/
